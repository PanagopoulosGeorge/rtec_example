# RTEC: Run-Time Event Calculus

RTEC is an open-source [Event Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_calculus) dialect optimised for data stream reasoning. It is written in Prolog and has been tested under [YAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAP_(Prolog)) and [SWI Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/).

#### YAP Installation Instructions

[YAP 6.3](https://github.com/vscosta/yap-6.3) is the latest stable version of YAP; installation and execution instructions may be found in this [manual](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~vsc/yap/index.html).

In case the installation of YAP fails (we have noticed this in Ubuntu 20 LTS), please download YAP 6.3 from the "threads" branch of the [repository]((https://github.com/vscosta/yap-6.3)). To do this from the command line, please type:

``` git clone -b threads https://github.com/vscosta/yap-6.3 yap```

where ```-b threads``` specifies that YAP will be downloaded from the "threads" branch.

# Features
- Interval-based.
- Sliding window reasoning.
- Interval manipulation constructs for non-inertial fluents.
- Caching for hierarchical knowledge bases.
- Support for out-of-order data streams.
- Indexing for handling efficiently irrelevant data.

# File Description

To run RTEC you need the files in the /src directory.

The /examples directory is **optional** and includes patterns and sample datasets for experimentation.
