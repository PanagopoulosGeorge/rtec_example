# RTEC: Run-Time Event Calculus

RTEC is an open-source [Event Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_calculus) dialect optimised for data stream reasoning. It is written in Prolog and has been tested under [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) and [YAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAP_(Prolog)) in Linux, MacOS and Windows.

This is the second version of RTEC, with support for events with delayed effects, as well as efficient handling of cyclic dependencies among fluents.
