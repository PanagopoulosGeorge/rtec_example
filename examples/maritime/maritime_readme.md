# Directory Structure
- **resources.** Original and compiled patterns along with declarations and auxiliary domain knowledge.
- **dataset.** This folder contains a download link for a dataset which includes vessels sailing the area near the port of Brest for six months. After download the ".csv" file containing the dataset, place it in this folder. 
- **results.** Directory of the execution logs.


# Execution Examples
- ```.\run_rtec.sh --app=maritime --window-size=7200 --step=3600``` runs RTEC on the maritime application for a window size of 2 hours (7200 seconds) and a step size equal to 1 hour. In this, case RTEC is executed with overlapping windows, in order to accommodate delayed events.
