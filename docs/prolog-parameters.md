## Execution in Prolog

### Setting Execution Parameters
  1. Navigate to the "execution scripts" folder and open the "handleApplication.prolog" file with your preferred text editor. This file contains multiple definitions for the handleApplication predicate, the second argument of which is the name of an existing application. The available applications include "caviar", "ctm" and "toy".
  2. The body of each handleApplication rule includes parameter assignments.  For example, WM=30 and Step=30 set the window size and the slide step to 30.  A description of the available parameters is outlined at the top of the file. We encourage you to examine various parameter values in your experiments.
  3. Save your changes, if any, and close "handleApplication.prolog".
