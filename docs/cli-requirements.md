## CLI Tools

### Requirements

To execute RTEC via our CLI you need, at the very least: 

- [SWI-Prolog 8.2+](https://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable) or [YAP 6.3](https://github.com/aartikis/RTEC/blob/master/docs/yap_installation.md).
- A version of [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/) with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) and [setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/).

The CLI also requires the [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/) package which is installed automatically via setuptools (see the instructions below).
